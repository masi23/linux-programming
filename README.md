# Linux Programming
This repository contains C programs focused on Linux systems programming. The projects demonstrate key concepts such as thread management, process creation, and shared memory.

## Contents
- threads-management.c -
A program demonstrating the creation and management of threads in Linux using the pthread library.

- processes-management.c -
A program showcasing process creation and termination using system calls like fork() and exec().

- shared-memory/ -
A folder containing programs that illustrate inter-process communication (IPC) using shared memory mechanisms (shmget, shmat, etc.).

These programs were made on Operating Systems classes at my Computer Science University.
